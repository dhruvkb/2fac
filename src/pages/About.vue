      2Fac is a TOTP generator.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      There are several multi-factor authenticator applications out there.
      Why make another one? Because they're terrible, and we can do better. I
      can explain... let me explain...
    </p>

    <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-8">Unparalleled beauty</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Hardly any of the authenticator apps focus on aesthetics and user
      experience. 2Fac is different. It has been designed with utmost
      attention to detail and an unwavering dedication to beautiful UI/UX.
    </p>

    <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-8">Data ownership</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Authenticator apps tend to lock you in. 2Fac does not need you to sign
      up, nor does it keep any of your data. You always own your data and can
      revoke our access whenever you want.
    </p>

    <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-8">Unrestricted access</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Few authenticator apps support multi-device, and those that do are
      cumbersome. 2Fac is built on web technologies and supports as many
      devices as you have. There's no device limit of any kind.
    </p>

    <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-8">Free and open source</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Most authenticator apps are closed source. 2Fac isn't. Every bit of the
      source code involved in the project is open-source. Found a bug? Patch it.
      Need a feature? Add it.
