        Multifac is a TOTP generator. There are several multi-factor
        authenticator applications out there. Why make another one?

      <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-4 mb-2">Unparalleled beauty</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 mb-4">
        Hardly any of the authenticator apps focus on aesthetics and user
        experience. Multifac is different. It has been designed with utmost
        attention to detail and an unwavering dedication to beautiful UI/UX.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-4 mb-2">Data ownership</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 mb-4">
        Authenticator apps tend to lock you in. Multifac does not need you to sign
        up, nor does it keep any of your data. You always own your data and can
        revoke our access whenever you want.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-4 mb-2">Unrestricted access</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 mb-4">
        Few authenticator apps support multi-device, and those that do are
        cumbersome. Multifac is built on web technologies and supports as many
        devices as you have. There's no device limit of any kind.
